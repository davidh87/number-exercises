# Number exercises for TDD and pairing practice

Complete any of the java files under src/main/java. A test is provided to give an example that should pass once fully implemented.

# TDD Rules

Complete the cycle of:
- Write a single failing test
- Write only enough code to fix the failing test 
- Refactor your code without changing the behaviour

Additional rules
1. You cannot write a line of source code unless you are explicitly fixing a test
2. You must write only enough code to fix the failing test, nothing more
3. During refactoring, behaviour must not change for any existing implementation

# Pairing rules

## First exercise

The first exercise will operate on a compressed timer-based pairing:
1. Follow TDD principles
2. Select one driver and one navigator
3. Every 3 minutes, finish the single line of code you are writing then swap roles

## Second exercise

Complete the first exercise by using a form of ping-pong pairing:
1. Person A writes a failing test
2. Person B writes code to fix the test
3. Person B performs refactoring
4. Person B writes the next failing test
5. Person A writes code to fix the test
6. etc
